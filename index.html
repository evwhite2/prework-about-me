      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I'm an MBA student at Loyola University Chicago, I work full time at Arcelormittal on the international "I" beam imports. I strive to be learned and well-rounded, and I love challenges.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>Crystal Lake, IL (about 50 mi NW of Chicago)</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>Painting, biking, learning new things, being outdoors.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>The dream is to manage people in a firm committed to technological solutions for environmental issues.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Chicago, IL</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>Not only do I feel a sense of artistry in the 'design' aspects of being a web designer, but I also find a real freedom and empowerment in the process. Furthermore, I believe that if I want to have the kind of career I want in a technological role, I will need to have these skills on my tool belt in order to stay up to speed. It is more and more common for kids to come out of high school with a bit of coding experience. I will not allow myself to be left behind. Plus, like I said- I love a challenge.</p>
